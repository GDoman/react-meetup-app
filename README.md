# Purpose and technology

This project was part of React course that I took to learn that library. It is simple application that allows user to get list of meetups from remote server, add new meetup with adequate form and add or remove meetups to favorite list. Besides typical constructs like hooks or props app code also uses routing, forms management and communication with api (via Firebase).
